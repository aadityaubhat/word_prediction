well reflecting upon all of this has made me realize that i need to come up with ways for my sons to be able to have a better tool kit for conflict resolution i want them to grow in their relationship instead of letting their relationship with each other fizzle dear hubby and i always hope and pray that they will remain close for their entire lives make sure the shoe matches your foot type and running style having a shoe that suits your foot type is the best prevention for injury and pain the last corner before the straight road home two cards for me because typical me i went into crafty mode before i navigated my mind made a card following the theme then remembered my friend ruth the artist behind a passion for stamps is our sponsor this week so i could hardly forget to make a card using one of her lovely images especially as i am lucky enough to be on her design team  the image here is one of pettibones flowers of  gallerie sho from tokyo had on view three of these little beauties as well as two small marilyns  look at the dimensions the flowers are less than  inches square each painting is carefully screen printed stretched on canvas and framed with wee nails and slates of wood these miniscule works are reduced to sheer perfection oddly seeing theses tiny warhols touched me much more than seeing originals of course without the original fullsize 
pieces pettibones couldnt exist and yet seeing these lilliputian paintings is breathtaking they become objects trinkets toys that being said i do want a few things for my family and myself in  i just want us to spend more time together more meaningful time might be the better way to say it we are in the same room kind of together a lot i hope we can experience some fun things in life together the other thing i want is to spend more time outside and less time locked in the house i received a copy of lets go outside by jennifer ward for christmas and cannot wait to put it to good use on the same note i want to make things together bake with my kids do crafts that involve more than crayons and paper no really let them create lastly i just want to spend time with friends and family deepen the relationships we have im sure there are a few other things floating around but i do not want to make a list and this teetering on the line i am excited that this year i will not be pregnant nor will i have a newborn i have either been pregnant or nursing since august  while im not done nursing feeding an almost one year old is way different than a newborn except my almost one year old i need to stop saying this it cant be true still nurses at least six times a day anyways i dont know if we are done having kids forever but we are for now american life league ghostbusters ii one of the groups longterm members is tom who has been with the group for almost four years i was in a bad way early in  i had closed down and was struggling to cope with life and my physchiatrist sent me to the charleston centre in paisley for an eight week assertiveness management course on the very last session dr jane bentley came along as a treat with her bags of djembe drums and held a thirty minute workshop something just clicked and for the first time in ages i felt my troubles ebb away the very next day i plucked up the courage to go to buddy beats regular weekly meeting and i have been there ever since be respectful of and nice to your kids hold them close with your words and deeds show them the love they need and deserve dont send them to the corner of your life physically or emotionally my teenager called me crying from school the other day aside from the fact she hadnt slept well the night before she was heartbroken and for good reason once again her father my ex turned his back and gave her the cold shoulder i watch my daughter suffer and cry and my heart goes out but i also get angry she is genuinely confused and hurt and theres no amount of words that will fix it in my head im getting in my car driving  hours and kicking some ass im looking for blood sigh i guess ill behave its a cycle  cathy  claret toi mae and pap had a trailer that in my childs mind seems forever away from our home but when i look at the lot that held our home and their trailer today i wonder how they both fit both their home and mamaws were surrounded by flowers of all kinds roses tulips daffodils and iris to name a few to this day an iris remains my favorite flower especially a purple bearded iris there were
